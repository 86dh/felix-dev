Installation:
============

- Eclipse Kepler SR2 + java8 support + latest bndtools
- Install java7 + java8 JREs in eclipse, and set default Jvm to java 7. For java 8, i'm using 1.8.05 Jvm from Oracle
- checkout DM4: checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/felix/sandbox/pderop/dependencymanager-prototype dependencymanager-prototype
- import dependencymanager-prototype in Eclipse. Check if the org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark bundle compiles correctly (if not, possibly
adjust the project specific setting and check if it's using your installed java 8.
- build all the projects, the restart eclipse.

How to launch the stress test under bndtools:
============================================

The stress test performs two kind of tests on different Felix DI framework (currently, we support Felix DM4, Felix SCR, Felix iPOJO):

1) first kind of test: starts/stops several times each tested bundles. When started, the test bundle is expected to register/unregister several services.
And no processing is done at all in each component activation/deactivation methods (start/stop methods).

2) second kind of test: same test, but this time, some processing is done in each component start/stop methods.

To launch the stress test under BndTools, click on the bnd.bnd file of the "org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark" project, 
then click on "Run", then in "Run OSGi".

You should see something like that in the eclipse console:

How to interpret results:
========================

for each tested bundle, the time spent is displayed in nanos.
for example: 

  results=165645599,240534693,250335703,276343059,458505648

Here is how to interpret the results: when testing a bundle, the benchmark controller starts/stops it many times, then the 
elapsed time consumed to 1- start the bundle; 2- activate all services; 3- deactivate all services; 4- stop the bundle is recorded in a list.
Then this list is sorted: the first entry is the fastest execution time, the last entry is the slowest. the middle one is the
average.
We display the first entry (fastest), the entry at 1/4 of the list, the middle of the list (average), the entry at 3/4 of the list, 
and the last entry (slowest time)


Stress test scenario description
--------------------------------

For sake of simplicity, a simple scenario domain is used (actually, this example domain has been inspired from the "Java8 Lambdas" book, O'reilly):
We have the following services: 

"Artist" service: An Artist is an individual or group of musicians, who creates some "Albums". One Artist service depends on several Album services.
"Album" service: is a single release of musics, comprising several music Tracks. One Album depends on several Track services.
"Track" service: A piece of music.

The scenario is implemented in the following bundles

- org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.scenario: defines the interfaces.
- org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.scenario.impl: defines the basic implementations for the services.

The Scenario Controller (see org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.scenario/org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.scenario.impl) is in charge of starting/stopping many times
some DI specific bundles (DM4, SCR, iPOJO), which are expected to create all expected Artist/Album/Track services.

By default, when a tested bundle is started, it will create several Artists (see Artists.ARTISTS constant). each Artist depends on several Albums (see Artists.ALBUMS constant),
and each Album depends on several music Tracks (see Artists.TRACKS constants).

Here is the list of bundles which are testing dependency manager, scr, or iPojo:

- org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.dependencymanager: 
It contains a simple activator, which creates the various services.

- org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.dependencymanager.parallel: 
same as above, but using parallel dependency manager (Warning: This is a new feature, not yet committed, still under discussion with Marcel and Xander).

- org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.scr: 
contains a DS xml descriptor for declaring the Artist/Album/Track services. If you change the constants values of Artists.ARTISTS/Artists.ALBUMS/Artists.TRACKS in order to
support more or less services, then you have to regenerate the xml descriptor in ./src/org/apache/felix/dm/benchmark/scr/scr.xml.
To do so, you can modify the constants (in the Artists interface), then you have to run under eclipse the src/org/apache/felix/dm/benchmark/scr/XMLGenerator.java class.
It will generate in /tmp/scr.xml the new xml descriptor, which you have to copy to ./src/org/apache/felix/dm/benchmark/scr/scr.xml.

- org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.ipojo:
contains an iPojo Activator, using the iPojo API for declaring all the services.

The org.apache.felix.dm.benchmark.controller bundle, when starting, first stops all tested bundles.
Then for each one, it performs the following test (multiple times):

- register the ScenarioController service (using the OSGi BundleContext API)
- start the tested bundle
- wait for all expected services to be registered
- unregister the ScenarioController service (this will trigger a full deactivation of services, because all services are expected to depend on it).
- wait for all expected services to be unregistered
- stop the tested bundle.

All the elapsed time (nanoseconds) used to execute each iteration is then recorded in a list.
When enough iterations are done, the list is sorted (that is : the first entry in the list corresponds to the fastest execution time, and the
last entry corresponds to the slowest execution time).
Then, we display some meaningful entries in the list (like the first entry, the entry in the middle of the list (average), and the last entry (slowest).

We don't do an average, because usually, when running benchmark, some measurements does not reflect reality, especially, when there is a full GC or when the JVM is warming up.
(we actually do the same as in Java Chronicle: https://github.com/peter-lawrey/Java-Chronicle).
