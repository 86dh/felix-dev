Bundle-Description: This bundle watches a directory set by the aQute.fileinstall.dir property; the default \
is "load". JAR files in this directory are installed and uninstalled when they are no longer there. Updating
 the JAR file in the directory will update the bundle. The bundle allows you to use downloads from
 a browser, drag and drop, or the command line copy function, for OSGi management.
