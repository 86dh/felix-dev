This sub-project contains some examples using the Dependency Manager API and annotations:

- src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/conf:

This directory contains a component that is used to inject configuration (using Configuration Admin) service
to other components.  

- src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/hello:

A simple example with a service provider and a service consumer component, both declared using the DM API.

- src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/hello:

Same example as src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/hello, but using annotations.

- src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/device:

This is an example use case showing a Dependency Manager "Adapter" in action. Two services are registered in the
registry ("Device", "DeviceParameter"), each one having a common "device.id" parameter.
Then a "DeviceAccessImpl" adapter service is defined: it is used to "adapt" the "Device" service to a "DeviceAccess" service, which
provides the union of each pair of Device/DeviceParameter having the same device.id. The adapter also dynamically configure
the service properties of the adapted service.

- src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/device/annot:

Same example as in src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/device, except that the DM annotation is used instead
of the DM API.

- src/org/apache/felix/dependencymanager/samples/tpool:

Provides a ThreadPool in the OSGi service registry, in order to configure Dependency Manager to handle components dependency management 
and component lifecycle callbacks concurrently (Actor style). Notice that in the bnd.bnd file, we are using a special property:

  org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.parallel='!org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.samples.tpool, *',\
  
This property indicates that all components (except the threadpool itself, which is also defined using the DM API).
should be cached until the threadpool is registered in the registry. 
Once the threadpool is registered in the OSGi registry, then, the dependency manager will use that threadpool for activating other components. 
(see the org.apache.felix.dependencymanager/design.txt for more informations).
