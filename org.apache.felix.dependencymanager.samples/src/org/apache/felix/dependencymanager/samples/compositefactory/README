This Activator is an example usage of DM composite components. A composite component is implemented
using a composition of multiple object instances, which are used to implement a given service. 

The sample also uses a Factory approach in order to instantiate the composition of objects: A
"CompositionManager" is first injected with a Configuration that can be possibly be used to create
and configure all the composites.

Dependencies are injected in all objects in the composition.
