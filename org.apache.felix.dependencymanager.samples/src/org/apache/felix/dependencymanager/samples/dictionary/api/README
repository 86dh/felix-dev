This sample shows a "SpellChecker" application (using DM API) which provides a
"dictionary:spellcheck" GOGO shell command. The GOGO "dictionary:spellcheck" command accepts a
string as parameter, which is checked for proper existence. The SpellChecker class has a
required/multiple (1..N) dependency over every available "DictionaryService" services, which are
internally used by the SpellChecker command, when checking word existence.

A DictionaryService is defined using a FactoryConfigurationAdapterService , allowing to instantiate
many "DictionaryService" instances when some configurations are added to the
"org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.samples.dictionary.DictionaryConfiguration" factory pid from web
console. The factory pid configuration metatypes are defined using the bnd "metatype" annotations
(see DictionaryConfiguration.java).

The DictionaryService is decorated with a DictionaryAspect, which you can instantiate by adding a
configuration from web console, using a
"org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.samples.dictionary.annot.DictionaryAspectConfiguration" PID. The
aspect configuration metatype is also declared using the bnd metatype annotations (see
DictionaryAspectConfiguration.java).
