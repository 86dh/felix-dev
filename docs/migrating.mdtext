# Migrating from earlier versions

DependencyManager 4.0 has some API changes that need to be taken into account when migrating from DependencyManager 3. 

* A dependency can no longer be shared accross components. 
* You no longer have to call setInstanceBound() when adding a dependency from within the init() method of a component. Therefore the method ServiceDependency.setInstanceBound() has been removed.
* The DependencyManager 4 Shell commands are no longer available for framework specific shell implementations, and support the gogo shell only.
